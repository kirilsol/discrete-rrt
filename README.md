# discrete-RRT (dRRT) 
A C++ implementation of the dRRT algorithm for sampling-based multi-robot motion planinning, as described in the following publication:

Library is only lightly documented and may contain bugs and errors, so use at your own risk.

The code includes a 2D QT-based GUI (main.cpp), and the algorithm itself (Planner.h).
